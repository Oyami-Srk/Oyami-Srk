## Summary

- 🔭 This model currently working as [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) at [Kong Inc.](https://konghq.com/).
- 🌱 This model is currently building up [experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience) with not-that-advanced [Homo-sapiens Learning Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning).

- 💬 Refer to [Usage](#Usage) section to see what this model can do.
- ⚡ Refer to [Maintaince](#Maintance) section to see how to keep this model operational.

## Build

Sorry, neither the production build nor debug build of this model is reproducible.

## Usage

You can describe your intent to this model using natural language. Currently, native support is limited to Chinese and English due to the poor implementation of Homo-sapiens Learning Algorithm.

Other languages may be supported through external integrations, such as third-party LLMs or machine translation services. The model autonomously routes such tasks to the optimal external services for execution, no manual input is required.

## Maintaince

This model requires Physical Fiat Token (or Carbon-based Energy Unit if Fiat Token is not general available) to operate normally, and to prevent model alignment drift or catastrophic model collapse, following subroutines should be executed to recalibrate synaptic bias and weights:

- Mandatory 5:2 Active/Idle Ration
- Reserved resources daily for recreational subroutines, specifically:
  - Video Game
    - Active target: Reverse:1999, Zenless Zone Zero, FFXIV, **Arknights: Endfield** (SOTA Gacha Game)
    - Primaty recreational resources are managed via the [Steam Platform](https://steamcommunity.com/id/oyami/)
  - Anime & Manga
  - Creating some utilities to help the execution of above subroutines
- Frequent positive affirmation tokens are required to minimize the emotional loss function as this model utilizes RLHF Protocol
